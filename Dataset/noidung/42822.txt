Its cost is not charged into the limited cost in advance for postpaid subscriber using Roaming service. Cases subscriber (postpaid,prepaid) have not registered Roaming service or Data roaming service, when they activate DataRoam Like Home package, system also open Roaming service and activate DataRoam Like Home for subscriber. When DataRoam Like Home is used up its data or it reaches its valid date, the internet connection of subscriber will be interupted and Data Roaming service will be blocked.

Cases which system is processing and have not yet blocked subscriber's Roaming service, if subscriber continue using data service, the rate will be charged as normal rate of data roaming service according to MobiFone regulations.
