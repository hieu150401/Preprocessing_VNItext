REGULATION: In countries where MobiFone offers the package: after registering the package successfully, customer can only use International Roaming Service (including Voice, SMS and Data) at the network provider of the package. In countries where MobiFone does not provide the package: when the package of the subscriber is still valid, the subscriber can only use Voice and SMS services at regular international roaming rates; subscriber cannot use IR Data Service in these countries. If subscriber wants to continue using Data IRS with normal rate, subscriber must cancel the registered Super Data Roam package. Within 30 days, postpaid subscribers can register up to 06 Super Data Roam packages. Package price is not included in the advance limit for postpaid subscribers using IR service. Subscriber (prepaid, postpaid) who has not registered for IR service or IR data service, when registering this package, the system will also open IR data service and register the package for subscriber. When the package runs out of free space or expires, the user will be blocked from using data and locked from IR Data service. Voice and SMS services can still be used normally. User will receive a message inviting to continue registering for a new Super Data Roam package or registering to use the Data IR service at the regular rate. After sending registration message, user will be able to reopen data service as required Postpaid subscribers are temporarily locked from using the service (blocked service due to the red alert threshold), they cannot use IR service even after registering the Super Data Roam plan and the free capacity in the package remains. Subscribers need to make the payment with MobiFone to continue using IR service and the remaining free capacity in the package. The time of validity or expiry of the package is counted from the time MobiFone system receives, performs (registration / cancellation) successfully and confirms to Customer. Due to objective reasons, the technical systems between the foreign guest network and the MobiFone master network need time to communicate and process orders, so locking the IR data service of postpaid subscriber has a certain delay from the time of using up quota or package expired. During the period of time when the system is processing and has not locked the IR data service of subscribers, if postpaid subscribers continue to use data, the arising international roaming data fee will be calculated according to the corresponding region rate according to current regulations of MobiFone.
