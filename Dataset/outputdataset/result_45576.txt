REGULATIONS : At places that allows subscriber to use Roam EU : after succesful registration , customer can only use Roaming service ( including Voice , SMS and Data ) at network which package allows . At places that does not allow subscriber to use Roam EU : During the time Roam EU is still valid , subscriber can only use Roaming service of Voice and SMS with the normal roaming rate ; unable to use data roaming . If subscriber wants to use data roaming service with normal rate , customer needs to cancel the Roam EU. Within 30 days , postpaid subscriber can register maximum 10 packages of Roam EU. Roam EU ' s fee does not count into postpaid ' s advance limitation fee for Roaming service . Cases that Prepaid / Postpaid subscriber have not yet activated Roaming service or Data Roaming service , after Roam EU is activated sucessfully , Data Roaming service will be also activated as well as Roam EU. When user finishes free data or usage days of Roam EU , Data Roaming service will be blocked . Voice and SMS can be used normally . Subscriber will receive an offer SMS to register new package of Roam EU or Data Roaming service with normal rate . After sending registration SMS , Data Roaming service will be re - opened . Cases that postpaid subscriber has been temprarily blocked ( because of over limitation ) , subscriber is unable to use Data Roaming even if the Roam EU is already activated and still have data remains . Subscriber needs to make all of the payment with MobiFone to continue using the service . Cases that customer finishes free data of this package , the system will block its service in HLR after doing the same in IN / ICC to prevent internet access . The_time starts or ends Roam EU will be calculated by the time MobiFone ' s system receive , process ( registration / cancellation ) its request succesfully and confirm it to customer . For objective reason , technical systems between other countries and MobiFone need time to process , so blocking Data Roaming for Postpaid subscriber may be late from the time customer uses up free data or reaches the valid date of this package . During the time technical systems processing and being unable to block Data Roaming service for subscriber , the arise of data roaming service will be calculated with normal roaming rate in that area if user continue using data roaming according to regulations .
