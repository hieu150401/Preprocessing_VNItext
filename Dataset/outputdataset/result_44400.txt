REGULATION : Subscriber who registers for the package ( known as main subscriber ) , after registering the package successfully , he / she will be entitled to register for other subscribers ( called supplementary subscribers ) in the group using the package . The_main subscriber is allowed to register and cancel the registration for the supplementary subscribers in the group . Each supplementary subscriber when registered to DataRoam Share package will be created a data account with a data capacity of 10MB ( virtual package ) , when using up the shared capacity of DataRoam Share package , the system will continue charging to the account DATARM of supplementary subscriber ( 10MB ) , when subtracting up DATARM account of supplementary subscriber , the system will block the international roaming data of data of the supplementary subscriber . Each supplementary subscriber within the DataRoam Share group can check the details of the DataRoam Share package or leave the user group . In countries where MobiFone provides the DataRoam Share package : after registering DataRoam Share package successfully , customers can only use International_Roaming service ( including Voice , SMS and Data ) in the network listed in the scope of implementation of the DataRoam Share package . In countries where MobiFone do not provide the DataRoam Share package : when the DataRoam Share package is still valid , the subscribers can only use Voice and SMS services according to the usual international roaming rates ; the subscribers cannot use international roaming Data Service in these countries . If subscribers want to continue using international roaming data service with normal international roaming rates , subscribers must cancel the registered DataRoam Share package . Within 30 days , postpaid subscribers can register up to 05 Share DataRoam packages . DataRoam Share package price is not included in the advance limit for postpaid subscribers using international roaming service . In case subscriber ( prepaid , postpaid ) has not registered international roaming service or international roaming data , he / she wants to register for DataRoam Share package , the system will simultaneously open international roaming data service and register DataRoam Share package for subscribers in the group . When the DataRoam Share package runs out of free capacity or expires , the users in the group are disconnected from data usage and international roaming data service . Voice and SMS services still work normally . The_users of the DataRoam Share package will receive a message inviting to continue registering a new DataRoam Share package or registering to use international roaming data service at regular rates . After sending a registration message , the data will be reopened as required In case the postpaid subscribers are temporarily locked out of the service ( blocking the service due to exceeding the red alert threshold ) , the supplementary subscribers of the group cannot use the international roaming service even if they have registered DataRoam Share package and the free capacity in the package is still available . Main subscriber needs to pay for MobiFone to continue using international roaming service and the remaining free capacity in Share DataRoam package In case customer uses up the free capacity in the registered package , the system sends the lock order on the HLR after locking the service on the IN / ICC to limit the requests for Internet connection . The_effective or expired time of DataRoam Share package is calculated from the time that MobiFone system receives and executes ( registration / cancellation ) successfully and confirms for customers . Due to objective reasons , technical systems between foreign and MobiFone host networks need time to communicate and process orders , locking the international roaming data service of postpaid subscribers has a certain delay since the time run_out of capacity or the package expires . During the time the system is processing and has not locked the international roaming data service of post - paid subscribers , if the postpaid subscribers continue to use the data service , the international roaming data fee arises according to the current international roaming rates of MobiFone regulations . At_one point , the subscribers can only be listed in 01 Share DataRoam package If subscriber registers another new DataRoam Share package when the old DataRoam Share package is still valid , the system will cancel the old DataRoam Share plan and register the new package for the subscriber . When the customer ( main subscriber ) registers the new DataRoam Share package , the old DataRoam Share package will be canceled , the customer cannot use the remaining free capacity of the canceled package . When customers successfully register a new DataRoam Share package , the remaining free volume of DataRoam Share package canceled or expired will not be accumulated into the free capacity of the newly registered DataRoam Share package .
